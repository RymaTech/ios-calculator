# iOS Calculator

As part of the pre-course for [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) Software Development bootcamp, I was asked to create a calculator. Rather than create my own _'Ryma Tech'_ styled calculator, I thought it would be fun to replicate Apple's iOS (12.1.4) calculator.

Available on [Github Pages](https://rymatech.github.io/ios-calculator/).

Completed February 2019.
